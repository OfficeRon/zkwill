idea-

I want to write the circuit- circom that will be the core of everything, I need this things-
The requirements will be-
I will discuss for whom the proof will be valid and then from that we can find the best way to implement it-

A User inputs money into a smart contract- insert commitment into the tree together with his will-
In anytime the user-owner can come and take the money from that will with his secret and then the will isn't valid anymore,
The important scenrio is such that the User-owner of the will- will be able to give to his potential heirs a secret- such that only after a time- that was appointed when he created the will- the heir secret will be used in a valid proof- while they DON'T hold the owner's secret.

meaning-
there will be 2 secrets- when the owner is creating the will- heirs secret and his own secret,
1- whenever he wants he will be able to use his secret- in order to verify and take his will out
2- the heirs secret will be available to be used as a verification true only after a specific time as past- lets stay 1 year from the will creation.- until that timestamp has reached the proof will return false...

Please help me figure it out to my needs, if the approach with 2 secret- 1 for the owner and 1 for the heirs isn't good- let me know a better way and let's figure it out together.

thanks!
